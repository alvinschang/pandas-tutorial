# Pandas + Jupyter tutorial - a very quick intro

This is a tutorial to help you get started with Pandas, even if you have little or no programming knowledge. This tutorial walks you through an example that can be easily altered to analyze your own dataset.

First some definitions:

* **Python** is a programming language. It is used for all types of things â€“ building websites, scraping the internet, AI, analyzing dat, etc. 
* **Pandas** is additional code for Python (a "library") that makes data analysis easier in Python.
* **Jupyter Notebook** is interface that allows you to write code in your browser. It's brilliant because you can write a line of code, run it, and see the output (tables or charts) instantly.     

### 1. Install programs

We have to install the three things above before we get started. But luckily there's a quick and easy way to install everything we need using something called Anaconda.

[Click here for instructions on how to install Anaconda](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install/).

### 2. Download the tutorial

* If you use Github, clone this repository. 
* If you don't use Github, click on the green "Code" button at the top of this page. Then click "Download ZIP".

Download these in a place you can easily find later.

### 3. Launch JupyterLab

After you install Anaconda, you will see an app called Anaconda Navigator on your computer.

Open it and the interface will allow you to install Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab.

Once installed, you can launch either application. Launch JupyterLab.

### 4. Open the tutorial

On the left side of the interface, you will see your file system. Navigate to where you downloaded the tutorial.

Double-click on `titanic.ipynb`.

This is a Jupyter Notebook. These files have the extension `.ipnyb`.

### 5. Follow along

Jupyter Notebooks allow you to write words and code! So from here on out, follow along in Jupyter Lab.
